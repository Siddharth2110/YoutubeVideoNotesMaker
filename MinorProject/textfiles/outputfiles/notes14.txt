 Examples of Deliberate PracticeOne of my favorite examples of deliberate practice is discussed in Talent is Overrated by GeoffColvin. In the book, Colvin describes how Benjamin Franklin used deliberate practice to improve hiswriting skills.When he was a teenager, Benjamin Frankl amin Franklin was criticized by his father for his poor writing abilities. Unlikemost teenagers, young Ben took his fathers advice seriously and vowed to improve his writing skills. . . by finding a publication written by some of the best authors of his day. Then, Franklin wentthrough each article line by line and wrote down the meaning of every sentence. Next, he rewroteeach article in his own words and then compared his version to the original. Each time, I discoveredsome of my faults, and corrected them. Eventually, Franklin realized his vocabulary held him backfrom better writing, and so he focused intensely on that area.Deliberate practice always follows the same pattern  pattern  pattern break the overall process down into parts, identify yourweaknesses, test new strategies for each section, and then integrate your learning into the overall process. ss. ss. ss. ss. ss. ss.
